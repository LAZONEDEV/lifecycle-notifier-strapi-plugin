## Adding and Managing Subscriptions

### Adding Subscriptions

1. **Create a New Subscription:**
   In the "Lifecycle Notifier" section, click on the "Add Subscription" button. Fill out the form in the modal that appears.

2. **Form Fields Description:**

   | Field                | Description                                                                                               |
   | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `Subject`            | Subject line for the notification email.                                                                  |
   | `Related collection` | Name of the collection for which the subscription is created.                                             |
   | `Event to listen`    | Type of event to trigger the notification (e.g., 'create', 'update', 'delete').                           |
   | `Recipient`          | Information about recipients who will receive notifications.                                              |
   | `Template`           | Email content in plain text or HTML format with placeholders for dynamic data (e.g., `<%= fieldName %>`). |
   | `File to join`       | Information about media fields to include in the notification email.                                      |

### Template Customization

Customize your email templates to include dynamic content from the collection. Use placeholders like `<%= fieldName %>` which will be replaced with actual data when the notification is triggered.

**Example Template:**

```html
<h2>New Product Created!</h2>
<p>Hello <%= clientName %>,</p>
<p>
  We are excited to inform you that a new product has been added to our
  collection.
</p>
<p>Product Details:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Name:</strong> <%= productName %></li>
  <li><strong>Price:</strong> $<%= productPrice %></li>
  <li><strong>Category:</strong> <%= productCategory %></li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for using our service!</p>
```

When a new product is added, placeholders like `<%= productName %>` will be replaced with actual product details.

### Managing Subscriptions

From the pluginâ€™s home page, you can manage (update, delete) existing subscriptions.

## Recipient Types

- **ENV (Environment Variable):** Use environment variables for dynamic recipient email addresses. Define recipients in the plugin configuration using the `envRecipients` field.

  **Example Configuration:**

  ```json
  {
    "lifecycle-notifier": {
      "enabled": true,
      "resolve": "../plugin",
      "config": {
        "envRecipients": ["TEST_RECIPIENT_EMAIL"]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **MODEL (Collection Field):** Reference email addresses from fields within the collection that triggered the event.

- **CUSTOM:** Specify custom email addresses directly in the subscription configuration.

## Adding Subscriptions via Configuration

You can also configure subscriptions directly in the plugin configuration file to maintain them in your base code.

**Example Configuration:**

```json
{
  "lifecycle-notifier": {
    "enabled": true,
    "resolve": "../plugin",
    "config": {
      "subscriptions": [
        {
          "collectionName": "api::planet.planet",
          "eventType": "afterCreate",
          "recipients": [
            {
              "type": "CUSTOM",
              "value": "custom@gmail.com"
            }
          ],
          "content": "Just send the name: <%= name %>",
          "mediaFields": ["image"],
          "createdAt": "2023-07-23T19:34:24.654Z",
          "updatedAt": "2023-07-23T20:01:03.075Z",
          "subject": "Testing subs in config"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
